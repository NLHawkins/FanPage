            For nearly seven years The Soulfeathers have lived, played, and made their music from the heart.
            Honing their craft and learning to fly, they have developed a faithful following lovingly known
            as “Featherheads.” Their diverse musical heritage leads to a style of music that defies definition.
            From Country Blues to Funk Jams, The Soulfeathers create music all their own, bringing a hard-
            driving, hook-laced, roots rock attitude. Blending thoughtful songwriting with an unmistakable
            southern soul, The Soulfeathers’s sound is like a sipping whiskey that goes down smooth while the
            burn lets you know its working. They have played many festivals including five years at Fall For
            Greenville and Spittoono music festival. They have opened for Robert Randolph and the Fam-
            ily Band, Alabama Shakes, Aj Ghent Band, Dangermuffin, Jonathan Tyler and the Northern
            Lights, Truth and Salvage Co., St Paul & the Broken Bones, and Yo Mama’s Big Fat Booty Band just
            to name a few. Home grown in South Carolina and raised in Clemson, The Soulfeathers offer purely organic energy
            that is both timeless boldly pioneering.
